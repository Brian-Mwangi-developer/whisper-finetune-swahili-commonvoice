## Whisper Fine-Tuning on Common Voice Swahili Dataset
This repository contains the code and steps to fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper model on the Common Voice Swahili dataset using the Hugging Face transformers library.

## Model Overview
Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model developed by OpenAI. It is capable of transcribing multilingual audio and fine-tuning it on specific datasets for improved performance in targeted languages.

In this project, we fine-tune Whisper on the Swahili subset of the Common Voice dataset.
